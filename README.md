# php-dalle
OpenAI Dalle PHP implementation

Fairly easy as per usual ! 


Dalle.php is the Object to make a call to the Dalle OpenAI API and retrieve answer

generator.php creates an image

index.html is where your browser should go to prompt image you want and see it.


Configure Dalle.php putting in your API key in function API_Key
then using browser go on http://whereisyourserverorlocalhost/index.html


And.. enjoy ! 


Very simple implementation, very fun.. PHP8.x and OpenAI Dalle API from 03.2023
